# Expo Linking API Silent Failure

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Expo's `Linking` API where attempts to open URLs can fail silently without throwing any errors. This makes debugging incredibly difficult as there's no clear indication of the failure. The proposed solution provides a more robust method for handling these silent failures.

## Problem

The standard `Linking.openURL` method in Expo doesn't provide reliable error handling for scenarios where the URL fails to open, particularly when the target app doesn't respond or network conditions prevent the opening. The app hangs momentarily, giving no error message or log to help with debugging.

## Solution

The solution involves adding a timeout mechanism.  If the URL isn't opened within a certain time frame, we can assume failure and handle it accordingly.  While not perfect, it provides a more reliable way to identify and manage these silent failures.
