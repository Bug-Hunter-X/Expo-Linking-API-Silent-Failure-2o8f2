This solution introduces a timeout to detect silent failures in the `Linking.openURL` call.  If the URL isn't opened within the specified timeout, it's assumed to have failed. This provides a more robust error handling mechanism.

```javascript
import * as Linking from 'expo-linking';

const openUrlWithTimeout = async (url, timeout = 5000) => {
  let resolved = false;
  const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
    resolved = true; // Set resolved to true if timeout occurs
    console.error(`Timeout opening URL: ${url}`);
  }, timeout);

  try {
    await Linking.openURL(url);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error opening URL:', error);
  } finally {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId); 
    if (!resolved) { //Check if timeout occurred. If not, then URL was successfully opened
      console.log('URL opened successfully:', url);
    }
  }
};

openUrlWithTimeout('https://www.example.com');
```
